# SQL Data Analysis Project: Unicorn Companies

This project involves analyzing a dataset of unicorn companies using SQL. The dataset is sourced from Maven Analytics and contains information about companies that 
have achieved a valuation of over $1 billion.

## Dataset

The dataset includes details about various unicorn companies, such as their valuations, funding rounds, and the time taken to achieve unicorn status.
The data is categorized by continents, allowing for regional analysis.

## Objectives

- Calculate Return on Investment (ROI) for each company and investor.
- Finding the trend (years) that most of unicorn has rises
- Determine the number of years it took for companies to become unicorns.
- Calculate YoY changes on unicorn trend 
- Identify unicorns by its industries
- Identify the top 5 companies by valuation amount, segmented by continent, country, and cities

## SQL Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency for analysis.
- **Aggregation**: Using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `COUNT` to derive insights.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Utilizing the `WITH` statement to structure complex queries for clarity and reusability.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency for analysis.
- **Ranking**: Using `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` to identify top companies by valuation and funding.
- **Conditional Statements**: Applying `CASE` statements for calculating metrics based on conditions.

## Tools

- **SQL**: The primary language used for querying and analyzing the dataset.
- **Maven Analytics**: Provided the unicorn companies dataset.

## Results

The analysis provided insights into:

- **ROI Calculations**: Understanding the profitability of investments in unicorn companies.
- **Years to Unicorn Status**: Identifying trends in how quickly companies achieve unicorn status.
- **Top 5 Valuations**: Highlighting the most valuable unicorn companies.
- **Top 5 Funding by Continent**: Identifying leading companies in terms of funding in different regions, country and cities.
- **YoY changes**: Identify Year on Year changes on unicorn trend.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of SQL in analyzing business metrics and provides valuable insights into the performance and growth of unicorn companies globally. 
By leveraging SQL, we can efficiently analyze large datasets and uncover meaningful patterns.


## Future Work
